<h1 align="center">The Skeld</h1>

Skeld is the first map created in Among Us in 2018. The map contains 14 areas and 19 tasks divided into 3 sections and these sections are:
- Common Task
- Short Task
- Long Task

And these are the 14 areas in **The Skeld** Map:
- **Cafeteria (Spawn Location)**
- **Admin**
- **MedBay**
- **Upper Engine**
- **Security**
- **Reactor**
- **Lower Engine**
- **Electrical**
- **Storage**
- **Communications**
- **Shields**
- **Navigation**
- **O2**
- **Weapons**

## Common Task:
Common Tasks are tasks shared by all Crewmates, and these tasks are:
- **Fixing Wires**
- **Swipe Card**

Swipe Card is located in **Admin** (South East of Cafeteria)

Fixing Wiring is located in **Cafeteria/Security/Electrical/Navigation/Admin**

**Fixing Wiring have 3 stages to finish and these are the stages:**

| Location Name | 1st Stage rate | 2nd Stage rate | 3rd Stage rate |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Admin        | 15%           | 30%           | 5%            |
| Storage      | 30%           | 20%           | 0%            |
| Cafeteria    | 0%            | 20%           | 30%           |
| Navigation   | 5%            | 30%           | 15%           |
| Electrical   | 50%           | 0%            | 0%            |
| Security     | 0%            | 0%            | 50%           |

```
Stages Information are from Among Us Wiki
```

And this the last of change to get a common task if its was set in **Lobby Settings** like this:
- [x] Common Task: 1

| Task Name | Chance |
|--------|-------|
| Swipe Card | 50% |
| Fixing Wiring | 50% |

- [x] Common Task: 2

| Task Name | Chance |
|--------|-------|
| Swipe Card | 100% |
| Fixing Wiring | 100% |

if you're impostor to make sure that the **Swipe Card** or **Fixing Wiring** is avaliable open **Task List** and you will find:
- [x] Admin: Swipe Card

or

- [x] Location: Fixing Wiring (0/3)

or you can find both if Common Task are 2

if you become impostor use this map:

```
Electrical (1st stage):
├── Navigation (2nd stage)
├── Cafeteria (2nd stage)
├── Admin (2nd stage)
├── Storage (2nd stage)
│
└──── Security (3rd stage)
└──── Cafeteria (3rd stage)
└──── Navigation (3rd stage)
└──── Admin (3rd stage)
-------------------------------
Storage (1st stage):
├── Navigation (2nd stage)
├── Cafeteria (2nd stage)
├── Admin (2nd stage)
│
└──── Security (3rd stage)
└──── Cafeteria (3rd stage)
└──── Navigation (3rd stage)
└──── Admin (3rd stage)
-------------------------------
Admin (1st stage):
├── Navigation (2nd stage)
├── Cafeteria (2nd stage)
├── Storage (2nd stage)
│
└──── Security (3rd stage)
└──── Cafeteria (3rd stage)
└──── Navigation (3rd stage)
-------------------------------
Navigation (1st stage):
├── Cafeteria (2nd stage)
├── Admin (2nd stage)
├── Storage (2nd stage)
│
└──── Security (3rd stage)
└──── Cafeteria (3rd stage)
└──── Admin (3rd stage)
```
**Don't forgot to choose 2nd stage/3rd stage by yourself, this is the best method to fake or catch the impostors faking wiring (even if its there in the task list**

## Short Tasks:
**Short Tasks** is the tasks that take short time to finish such as: **Divert Power** and here the list of **Short Tasks** with their location:

- **Divert Power (1st stage at electrical, 2nd stage could be at lower/upper engine, security, communications, shields, navigation, o2, weapons) and these are the change to get the 2nd stage in different locations**:

| 2nd Stage | Chance |
|--------|-------|
| Upper Engine | 12.50% |
| Lower Engine | 12.50% |
| Security | 12.50% |
| Communications | 12.50% |
| Shields | 12.50% |
| Navigation | 12.50% |
| O2 | 12.50% |
