The Scientist appeared in the biggest update to Among Us, which was the update **V2021.11.09 (9 November 2021)**, The role appeared with many others such as ShapeShifter, Engineer and others..., The Role feature is a usefulfor checking the Vitals of Crewmates to see if they are alive or dead. If they are dead, the button will be red; blue means alive; and gray means they died in the previous rounds, However, there is a battery duration for the list and a specific duration set by the Lobby Host in the settings

Also, This feature is also available to all Crewmates in [The Airship](airship.md) and [The Polus](polus.md) maps, But it's only in certain places and not always with you

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some Expert Lobbies ban you because of this feature, but if you're a Scientist, they'll allow it. However, maps with the menu on the map are blocked in some lobbies
