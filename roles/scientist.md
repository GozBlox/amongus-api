The Scientist appeared in the biggest update to Among Us, which was the update **V2021.11.09 (9 November 2021)** , The role appeared with many others such as ShapeShifter, [Engineer](engineer.md) and others..., The Role feature is a useful for checking the Vitals of Crewmates to see if they are alive or dead. If they are dead, the button will be red; blue means alive; and gray means they died in the previous rounds, However, there is a battery duration for the list and a specific duration set by the Lobby Host in the settings

Also, This feature is also available to all Crewmates in [The Airship](airship.md) and [The Polus](polus.md) maps, But it's only in certain places and not always with you

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some Expert Lobbies ban you because of this feature, but if you're a Scientist, they'll allow it. However, maps with the menu on the map are blocked in some lobbies

## What you can do:
- Check Crewmates Vitals: You can see if a player is alive or dead in the round, and the way to find out is as follows: 
  - Red Button: This means that the player was killed but their body was not reported (impostor is excluded)

  - Blue Button: This means that player is still alive (impostor also included)

  - Grey Button: This means that player is dead or got voted out from previous rounds (impostor also included only if he got voted out)

## What you can't do:
- you CAN'T Check Dead Player Location: You cannot know the location of a dead Crewmate because this role only tells you if someone has died or if people are still alive

### Note:
- Impostors Button in the vitals never and can't be in **Red Button** they only can be in **Blue Button** and **Grey Button**
- Crewmates Button in the vitals can be in any color
- If Someone said he's scientist and you think he is lying, ask him what the battery duration, if he didnt know, tell him to check next round and recall an meeting to reask him, if he said wrong duration then he's lying
