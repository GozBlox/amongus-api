# Viper 🐍:
The Viper is one of the most loved Role among the Among Us community, and the benefit of the Role is:

- Dissolve: The Lobby Host will set the dissolve duration, which is how long it takes for the body to dissolve/dissapear permanently and only reappear if you make a Meeting Call (the meeting call will show you who dead that round not the body location)

## Disadvantage:
- If the players saw you kill and the body had acid on it (green in color), they would know that the killer wasn't Shapeshifter, but viper, means they will vote you out

- Do not **KILL** in **Electrical, Medbay, or Security** because there are **engineers** constantly monitoring these areas and its called tringale method, and the best solution is to sabtoage **Communications** or kill in another areas
