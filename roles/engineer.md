The Engineer has been released in the biggest update yet in Among Us, and the update is: **V2021.11.09** such as: ShapeShifter, [Scientist](scientist.md), and more...

The engineer has an ability or feature that the impostor possesses, which is the ability to vent everywhere, but for a limited time as determined by the lobby host, This is what the Vent button looks like in the Engineer

However, if Communications is sabotaged, you will not be able to Vent and the button will look like this:

</p>
<h1 align="center">1st Bermuda Method</h1>

- This is one of the best ways to catch imposters because most imposters are killing in these places, especially in Electrical, which is called the graveyard of amongus, or you can see impostors phantom, shapeshift, if you saw **Viped Body** which have an acid above the body, means its not shapeshifter, the impostor role is [Viper](viper.md)
  - Also if the body is normal and you saw the killer and you checked his level is very low (Level 20 and below) means he's the killer (but don't forgot to chase him until he unss, if he didnt unss, then you know what to do

- This method is good but never used; it's the same as the 1st Bermuda Method but between Admin, Cafeteria, Shields/Navigation Hallway

<h1 align="center">Connected Vents</h1>

- The colors on the vents are for vents that are connected to each other, such as Security, Electrical, and MedBay. These are connected, meaning you can switch between the three, used for impostors and enginners
